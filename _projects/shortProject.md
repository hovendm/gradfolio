## Subjectivity and Narration Figured within *Swann in Love* ##

The first volume of Marcel Proust's *In Search of Lost Time* is a problematic one. The subjectivity of Swann breaks into the narrative here, at its outset, with a level of knowledge that the narrator never again expresses towards the intimate thoughts and motivations of other characters. This paper argues, using the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari surrounding proust, that this connection with Swann represents an important developmental stage in the narrative voice of the speaker in the search, and that the singularity of this occurance testifies to a critical movement across boundaries of subjectivity which is critical to how the novel develops as a whole.
