## Cartesian Dualism and Escape into Cyberspace ##

There is a recurring motif in the works of William Gibson of characters who want to escape from real life into cyberspace. This desire for escape is caught up in a series of presumptions, not just that cyberspace is seperate from the real world, but also that the mind which escapes into cyberspace is a priveleged and seperate point of subjectivity from the body. This essay looks at the the consequences of these presumptions, both literal in how they shape the course of these texts, but also the figurative significance for these characters and what happens to them.
