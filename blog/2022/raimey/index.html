<meta name="description" content="Revisionist and parody westerns were both already established as later modes by which western cinema could express itself by the time The Quick and the Dead came out, but it is an entry which fails neither into those categories nor into a more traditional western bracket. While in many ways it borrows from and pokes fun at the archetypes and story beats which might be seen in a more typical western, these elements do not come together into a sequence of action which mirrors or comments on the thematic or plotting content characteristic of western film. This is no failing on the part of the filmmakers, however, as the result is less a cohesive or fully formed entry into the western canon and instead a brief and loving jaunt into the aesthetics and character types of the cinematic west. While the film never has much to say about the content it draws from, or even something to say on its own, the acting talent and directorial flair makes this nevertheless an enjoyable flick; while the film does not have anything consequential to add to the choir of voices revisiting the cinematic west, it does not aim to. The often silly fun is enough to make this film a worthwhile watch." />
